This act and regulatory guidelines can serve as a model for impact analysis in any global setting. A special emphasis will be placed on understanding the implications of sustainable development for typical projects that occur in urban settings and the techniques used to assess impacts. Supporting field trips and discussions with planners and project managers are planned.\n",
