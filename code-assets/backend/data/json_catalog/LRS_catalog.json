In tandem with learning and doing science, students think about the philosophical and cognitive underpinnings of these facets of science. The course will also look at the nature of some of students\u2019 alternative conceptions in science and strategies for assessing children\u2019s existing beliefs. The laboratory component, LRS 200L, involves practicing physical science core ideas as both learners and teachers. As learners, they conduct physical science investigations themselves. As teachers, they teach lessons to elementary children based on the concepts learned and conduct interviews with the elementary children. This lab meets for 3 hours per week. 15 hours of offsite laboratory work is required.",
