This course provides a more in-depth view of social science research methods useful for social work practice with urban families.

Students also will learn how to use research to scientifically evaluate their own practice. This advanced-year course builds on knowledge of research concepts and methods developed during foundation year research courses particularly SWRK 535 as well as on the expansion of knowledge students acquire about human behavior social work practice and social welfare policies and programs. It extends students understanding of research methods and their ability to evaluate social work practice using a variety of research designs. Students will learn the skills of problem formulation operationalization and examination and utilization of the peer-reviewed literature by focusing on a research topic they are passionate about. This work will serve as the foundation on which students Capstone projects will be based.\n",

This course provides a more in-depth view of social science research methods useful for social work practice with urban families.  It provides the knowledge and skills that enable students to be intelligent consumers of information to conduct social research and to critically evaluate social work practice.  Students also will learn how to use research to scientifically evaluate their own practice. This advanced-year course builds on knowledge of research concepts and methods developed during foundation year research courses particularly SWRK 535 as well as on the expansion of knowledge students acquire about human behavior social work practice and social welfare policies and programs. It extends students understanding of research methods and their ability to evaluate social work practice using a variety of research designs. Students will learn the skills of problem formulation operationalization and examination and utilization of the peer-reviewed literature by focusing on a research topic they are passionate about. This work will serve as the foundation on which students Capstone projects will be based.\n",
