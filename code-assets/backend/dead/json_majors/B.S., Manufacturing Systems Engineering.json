        "Program Requirements",
        "The Manufacturing Systems Engineering program is based on an expectation of adequate high school preparation in science, mathematics and English. High school courses should include algebra, plane geometry, trigonometry and chemistry or physics (both desirable), and 4 years of English.",
        "CSUN provides the opportunity for students who have not had a complete background of pre-engineering work in high school to take courses to prepare for the major. These additional courses will not count toward the major and may increase the time to graduate. CSUN provides testing as outlined below to ensure that students start their engineering coursework at an appropriate level.",
        "Placement Exam Requirements",
        "The Mathematics Placement Test (MPT) is required prior to enrollment in MATH 150A. Students should take this exam before enrolling in their classes so they may be placed in the appropriate mathematics course. Students with scores of 4 or 5 on the AP Calculus AB or BC exams are exempt from the MPT.",
        "The Chemistry Placement Test (CPT) is required with a minimum score of 40 prior to enrolling in CHEM 101. Students who have had high school chemistry and expect to enroll in CHEM 101 must take this test regardless of their score on the AP Chemistry exam. Students who do not achieve this CPT score must complete CHEM 100 with a grade of C or better before taking CHEM 101.",
        "Special Grade Requirements",
        "All students must complete the lower division writing requirement before enrolling in 300-level engineering courses.",
        "A grade of C- or better is required in all courses in the major. A grade of C or better is required in all undergraduate transfer courses.",
        "Senior-level courses cannot be taken unless the student previously completed or is concurrently completing all freshman-, sophomore- and junior-level core requirements.",
        "A grade of C or higher is necessary in MATH 150B to meet the prerequisite requirements for the next-level math courses.",
