Students in B.A. degree programs must fulfill the University requirement of at least 40 units of upper division coursework overall.",
        "It is assumed that the student has a facility in mathematics normally gained by recent completion of four years of high school mathematics through trigonometry and Mathematical Analysis. Because of the variation in curricula at the high school level, it is necessary to obtain satisfactory scores on the Mathematics Placement Test (MPT) to enter the first mathematics course in the program, MATH 150A. Without satisfactory scores, a student will need to complete additional coursework.",
