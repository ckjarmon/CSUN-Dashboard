       "To enroll in the first courses in Mathematics and Chemistry, students must obtain a satisfactory score on the Mathematics Placement Test (MPT) and the Chemistry Placement Test (CPT). Without a satisfactory score, students may be required to take additional courses in preparation for the required courses. Students must complete the course requirements listed. In addition, all students are required to take two comprehensive exams\u2014one on general physics upon completion of PHYS 227 or its equivalent and one on advanced physics just before graduation. The dates of these exams will be posted in the department office. Finally, students are required to do a senior project in their final year and pass the associated class PHYS 497. For more information, consult the department undergraduate advisor.",
