Should progression through the curriculum be interrupted, students whose progress is interrupted will need to reapply to the program and will be considered on a space-available basis. All nursing courses must be completed within 5 years after taking the first nursing course.",
            "A minimum grade of C is required in all prerequisite and nursing courses. A grade of C- will require the student to repeat the course or concurrent theory/lab courses. All nursing courses may be repeated only once with a maximum of 15 repeated units. Students progressing on schedule through the program will be given priority space in classes, and students repeating courses will be considered only on a space-available basis. The need to repeat some courses may interfere with the repeating student's ability to complete the degree.",

            "Due to clinical requirements imposed by clinical affiliates, students are required to obtain and maintain at their sole cost the following clinical requirements: health exams and immunizations; evidence of TB test, titers or other required tests; background check; drug screening; nursing liability insurance; CPR certification; fire safety card; HIPPA and Bloodborne Pathogen training; and any other requirements deemed necessary by the clinical affiliates. Students must complete a preclinical checklist and provide proof that requirements are met 4 weeks prior to the start of their first clinical course. If an affiliating clinical agency notifies faculty that they are refusing clinical placement to a student based on a background check or drug screen, the student will be unable to complete the required clinical laboratory coursework, be unable to progress in the program and, thus, be unable to meet degree requirements.",

Clinical rotations can change each academic semester or year given external assignments of times and days.",
