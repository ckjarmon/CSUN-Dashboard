        "Program Requirements",
        "A. Admission to the Major",
        "Admission to the major in Music for all undergraduate degrees is determined by audition. Those auditioning for the Performance options must exhibit a high-performance competence in the audition. Audition procedures and standards are listed on the Department of Music\u2014Audition and Placement website.",
        "To enter the B.M. option in Percussion, one must pass an entry audition. Expectations are that the applicant will perform at an exceptional level on two of the major instruments (a mallet instrument, snare drum, timpani, etc.). Note: It is extremely unusual for a self-taught percussionist to pass the B.M. percussion audition.",
        "Typical materials used by students for this audition include: (a) a major solo piece or (b) a demanding exercise/\u00e9tude taken from a method book. It is strongly suggested that one's audition materials be selected in consultation with a professional teacher if at all possible.",
        "Transfer students seeking admission to Performance options must audition at the appropriate entrance level determined by the number of transferable units accepted by the University. (Example: At the time of the audition, students with more than 60 transferable units must demonstrate musical proficiency at the junior level for admission to a Performance option.) Exceptions to this policy are rare and are at the discretion of the Music department.",
        "B. Lesson and Ensemble Requirements",
        "To qualify for individual lessons in any semester, undergraduate students must be enrolled in a minimum of 12 units, including lesson units and the correct number of ensemble units required by their option.",
        "Enrollment in the designated ensemble(s) for the student's instrument is a corequisite of enrollment in private lessons each semester of enrollment. Students who do not meet this requirement by the third week of the semester will not be eligible for lessons that semester. Students enrolled in music ensembles in the Fall semester normally are expected to re-enroll in the same ensemble for the Spring semester. The nature of these classes makes it essential that consistent personnel be maintained throughout the year.",
        "All students enrolled in individual lessons must demonstrate their progress in the major before a faculty jury at the end of each semester of study. Students receiving lower than a grade of C- in that semester of lessons will need to take additional study at their own expense to achieve their required level of performance before resuming department-paid lessons.",
