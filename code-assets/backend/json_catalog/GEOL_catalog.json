Topics include: seismic wave equation, stress/strain theory, ray theory, tomography, reflection seismology, body waves, surface waves, source theory, anisotropy, inverse problems, signal processing, and introduction to normal modes. Concepts will be approached through lectures, scientific readings, group projects, analysis of seismic data sets, and study of basic seismology theory.
