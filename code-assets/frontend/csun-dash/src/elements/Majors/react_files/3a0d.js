<li>Undergraduate majors in Tourism, Hospitality, and Recreation Management are required to earn a grade of C or better in each of the core classes for the units to be counted as progress toward a degree.</li>
<li>Each class can be repeated once to improve the grade. Subsequent retakes must be appealed to the Department of Recreation and Tourism faculty. First Aid and CPR certification (non-online) is required at time of graduation.</li>
<li>Students must also complete a minimum of 400 hours of professional practice hours prior to graduation to develop professional competencies and to adequately prepare for their career.</li>
<li>Professional Preparation Opportunities</li>
<li>Professional learning experiences are offered to students throughout the program. Experiential education and community service learning opportunities are included in coursework. Students are provided the opportunity to engage in a wide variety of leisure organizations. Students complete their 400 minimum internship hours in several ways. At least 60 of these hours will be completed in core classes taken prior to taking two sections of the RTM 494C internship class (170 supervised hours of internship per section) in a career setting.</li>
<li>Internship: All students enroll in a capstone (6 units) senior internship. To ensure the highest-quality internship experience possible, the department requires all students to have completed all 200- and 300-level core courses and the majority of their electives package prior to enrollment in the internship program. However, it is strongly encouraged that the senior internship experience be taken as the culminating learning opportunity toward the B.S. degree. See academic advisor for further requirements.</li>
<li>Students consult with faculty regarding policies and procedures governing practical experience. Multiple professional certifications are both possible and encouraged through judicious selection of field placements and elective coursework.</li>
<li>Tourism, Hospitality, and Recreation Management (60 units)</li>
<li>The department is committed to providing a generalist framework from which students may seek one or more professional certifications. See advisor for specific career preparation patterns. Electives are selected in consultation with and approved by the departmental academic advisors.</li>
