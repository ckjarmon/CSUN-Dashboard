<li>Nursing courses from other programs may be considered nonequivalent and cannot be transferred into this program with the exception of NURS 307/L.</li>
<li>Students are admitted as a cohort. Should progression through the curriculum be interrupted, students whose progress is interrupted will need to reapply to the program and will be considered on a space-available basis. All nursing courses must be completed within 5 years after taking the first nursing course.</li>
<li>A minimum grade of C is required in all prerequisite and nursing courses. A grade of C- will require the student to repeat the course or concurrent theory/lab courses. All nursing courses may be repeated only once with a maximum of 15 repeated units. Students progressing on schedule through the program will be given priority space in classes, and students repeating courses will be considered only on a space-available basis. The need to repeat some courses may interfere with the repeating student's ability to complete the degree.</li>
<li>Students must enroll and pass concurrently both theory and clinical laboratory components of each area of study that contains these components.</li>
<li>Due to clinical requirements imposed by clinical affiliates, students are required to obtain and maintain at their sole cost the following clinical requirements: health exams and immunizations; evidence of TB test, titers or other required tests; background check; drug screening; nursing liability insurance; CPR certification; fire safety card; HIPPA and Bloodborne Pathogen training; and any other requirements deemed necessary by the clinical affiliates. Students must complete a preclinical checklist and provide proof that requirements are met 4 weeks prior to the start of their first clinical course. If an affiliating clinical agency notifies faculty that they are refusing clinical placement to a student based on a background check or drug screen, the student will be unable to complete the required clinical laboratory coursework, be unable to progress in the program and, thus, be unable to meet degree requirements.</li>
<li>Access to reliable transportation is required for clinical courses off campus.</li>
<li>Due to the clinical requirements imposed by external clinical partners, students must be prepared to attend clinical rotations in the community settings any day of the week, including weekends and at various times of the day, including evenings and nights. No reasonable student accommodation to clinical scheduling can be made given the cohort nature of the program and the external limitations placed on the department by hospitals and other clinical settings. Clinical rotations can change each academic semester or year given external assignments of times and days.</li>
<li>Given the cohort nature of the program and the program's requirements to match the clinical schedule offered to our students by our affiliating clinical agencies, scheduled clinical dates, times and hours cannot be modified to meet students' personal needs. Clinical rotations can change each academic semester or year according to changes in clinical agencies' schedules.</li>
<li>The faculty reserves the right to make program modifications as necessary to meet current professional standards, Board of Registered Nursing requirements and accreditation criteria.</li>
<li>Prior to and during clinical placements, students are required to demonstrate professional maturity and physical, emotional, ethical and moral fitness for clinical practice.</li>
